If you're playing with someone remotely, it may take a fraction of a second for their input to reach you, but even that can be enough to ruin your game experience."," ","Rollback uses predictions to reduce the effect of lag. Based on previous inputs, it predicts what the other user is going to do next, and shows you the result of that prediction, which is instant."," ","When the prediction is correct, you don't experience lag, and your game feels much more responsive."," ","However, sometimes the system realises its prediction was wrong. In that case, it ","rolls back"," to the last correct state, and continues the game from that point. This is why it's called \"","Rollback multiplayer","\"."],[" ","Rollback is deterministic. It only shares inputs with other players, and expects all of them to run the same logic on the given input, giving the same results on all clients."," ","A different approach to multiplayer is \"state replication\", which continually synchronises the state of the game between clients, ensuring they are always doing the same thing."," ","Rollback does not do that -- it only ever sends inputs, but also keeps an eye on the state so it can be rolled back in case of a wrong prediction."," ","What is a client?"," ","\n      A \"client\" is a player in your game, and refers to their copy of the game, running on their machine.
