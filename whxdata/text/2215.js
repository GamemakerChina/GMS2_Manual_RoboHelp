The final look of the primitive will depend on the primitive type chosen to draw (See ","draw_primitive_begin()"," for more information), the order with which you add the vertexes to it and the position of the start point you set for the texture. To end and draw the primitive you must call ","draw_primitive_end()",".","\n  ","You can also choose to draw only ","part"," of the texture over the surface of the primitive by setting the appropriate xtex/ytex position to sample to (these coordinates are also known as the ","UV"," points). This point is defined by a value between 0 and 1 with the top left corner of the image to use being the (0,0) point and the bottom right corner being the (1,1) point. In this way you can texture a primitive with only a part of the source image asset.","\n  ","When drawing a textured primitive, the texture will be blended with the colour set by ","draw_set_colour",".
