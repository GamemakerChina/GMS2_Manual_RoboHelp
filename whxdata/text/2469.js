","GameMaker"," supports this through the use of the UWP target and permits you to do the following:","\n  ","\n    ","Create a multiplayer session","\n    ","Find (and/or join) a multiplayer session","\n    ","Be notified when relevant players join or leave a session, as well as receive their network connection details","\n    ","Be notified when the session host migrates to a different user","\n    ","Get a list of users in the session","\n    ","Leave a session","\n  ","\n  ","To create a multiplayer session, you need to specify what ","Session Template"," is going to be used. These session templates are defined on the XDP, but an example is shown below:","\n  ","Session Name: MatchSession","\n    Contract Version: 107","\n    Session Template (JSON text):","\n    {","\n        \"constants\": {","\n            \"system\": {","\n                \"version\": 1,","\n                \"maxMembersCount\": 12,","\n                \"capabilities\": {","\n            },","\n                \"memberInitialization\": {","\n                    \"externalEvaluation\": false,","\n                    \"membersNeededToStart\": 1","\n                }","\n            },","\n            \"custom\": {}","\n        }","\n    }","\n  ","A description of the fields can be found in \"Session Overview\" in the XDK help file. Note that we currently don't support setting session parameters dynamically from ","GameMaker",".","\n  ","Along with the session template, a matchmaking hopper must also be set up to allow the session to be found (this is also done on the XDP). Hoppers are used to define rules which are used when matching players. As with session parameters, we don't currently support setting hopper parameters dynamically from GameMaker: Studio. See the \"SmartMatch Matchmaking Configuration\" section in the XDK help file for further details.","\n  ","The following functions are available for Xbox Live matchmaking (note that you will also need to use the ","GameMaker"," ","Networking Functions"," for the connections etc...):","\n  ","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_start","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_stop","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_create","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_find","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_session_get_users","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_join_session","\n    ","xboxlive_matchmaking_session_leave","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","GameMaker"," provides an extra set of matchmaking functions for you to use to invite other players on the network to join a session, or for you to accept an invitation to join someone else's session.
