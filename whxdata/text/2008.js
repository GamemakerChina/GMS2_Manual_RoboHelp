You give the two arrays to check, and the function will return ","true"," if they are equal (either equivalent or the same) or ","false"," if they are not. Note that this is ","not"," the same as checking if two arrays are the same using ==, which will not check to see if the two arrays hold equivalent values, but only to see if the arrays are referencing the same initial array.
