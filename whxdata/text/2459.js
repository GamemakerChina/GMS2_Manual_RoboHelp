Next you can assign a priority, which is then used to determine how sounds are dealt with when the number of sounds playing is over the limit set by the function ","audio_channel_num()",". Lower priority sounds will be stopped in favour of higher priority sounds, and the priority value can be any real number (the actual value is arbitrary, and can be from 0 to 1 or 0 to 100, as ","GameMaker"," will prioritise them the same).
