The index is the UTF8 map number for the first character to use and the ranges to use are the same as you would for a normal font, starting with \"!\" but remember that you should only include what you need and that you should be using the ","ord()"," function to get the correct UTF8 value for the starting letter.","\n  ","You can also set the spacing for the font to be proportional (","true",") or not (","false","), where a proportional font is spaced based on the actual width of the letters (so the letter \"i\" takes less room than the letter \"w\", for example) while a non-proportional font will be spaced based on the sub-image width, like a monospaced font. Finally, you can define the space to leave between each letter when writing, and this can be any integer value, with 0 being no space (the letters will \"touch\" if proportional). ","\n  ","If the function fails, then it will fail silently without replacing the given sprite font.","\n  ","It is also worth noting that there cannot be any ","spaces"," in the character map, so that if you, for example, use '.' and '0' but not '/', you need to either include '/' anyway or leave a blank sub-image between the two used characters.
