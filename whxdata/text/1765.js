This action is normally used in the ","Other - Outside Room Event"," or the ","Step Event"," and you can indicate whether to wrap only horizontally, only vertically, or in both directions, as well as set a margin. The margin value is the number of pixels outside of the room area that the instance must have moved before it will be wrapped around to the other side. Note that the instance must have a speed for wrapping to work, because the direction of wrapping is based on the direction of the motion.","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","\n  "],["\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Margin","\n        ","The margin around the edge of the room to check","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Horizontal","\n        ","Enable horizontal wrapping (on by default)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Vertical","\n        ","Enable vertical wrapping (on by default)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","The above action block code - placed in the Step Event - will wrap the instance around the horizontal or vertical axis when it is more than 32px outside the room area.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Movement Actions","\n        ","Next: ","Add Motion","\n      ","\n    ","\n    "],["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"]],"4":[[" Wrap Around Room"]],"5":[["Action Syntax:"],["Arguments:"],["Example:"]],"6":[["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2022 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"1765"})
