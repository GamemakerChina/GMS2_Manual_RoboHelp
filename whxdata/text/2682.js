Note that when a gamepad is plugged in to your device (or it is removed) then an asynchronous ","System Event"," is triggered where you can deal with the situation using the appropriate functions.","\n  ","The gamepad \"slots\" are indexed from 0 upwards, and the actual slot that a gamepad assigned will depend on a variety of factors, not least of which is the OS that the project is running on.

However you can also check slots 4 - 11 inclusive for ","DirectInput"," gamepads, which means you can detect many other models of controller when connected through these slots. On other platforms, pads may be detected on ","any"," slot that the OS has assigned it, which could slot 3 or slot 20 or more. For example, ","Android"," devices will store bluetooth gamepads in a slot and then reserve that slot for that gamepad in the future, whether it is connected or not, so you ","cannot"," assume that a single connected gamepad is connected to slot 0, as this will probably not be the case.","\n  ","It is worth noting that when using DirectInput gamepads on Windows, or generic gamepads on other platforms, the constants given below ","may not match exactly the buttons that you expect when they are pressed",", due to the fragmented and non-standardised way that the API is implemented by controller manufacturers.

Similarly, no input from gamepads will be detected while the game is not in focus, and we recommend that you use the function ","os_is_paused()"," or ","window_has_focus()"," to detect this and pause the game or something similar as any button being held down at the time the game loses focus will maintain the held down state until the game regains focus.","\n  "],["\n  ","The following list shows current compatibility across the platforms (note that this will change with future updates):","\n  ","\n    ","Windows ","is fully supported with up to a maximum of 12 connected devices permitted at once (numbered from 0 to 11, with 0 - 3 being XInput devices and 4 - 11 being DirectInput).
