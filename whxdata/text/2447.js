A user-defined function is one that you define to do a task that isn't covered by the built-in GML Visual actions or GML runner functions, and can be global, instance or local in scope (see ","here"," for more information on scope); they can also be used as ","constructors"," to create ","structs",". To find out more about using this action to create global functions, please see the section on ","Creating Action Functions",".","\n  ","To use this action, you can add it to an event or a script and give the new function a name. You then provide the required arguments/parameters that the function will take, and the default values for any optional arguments.","\n  ","If the function is to be used as a constructor (which is used to create a struct), then you need to check the ","Constructor ","option and later use the ","New"," action to create a struct from the function. You may also flag the function as being ","static",", which means that it will only be defined once no matter how many times this action is executed. Finally, if the function is only going to be used locally in the same event and nowhere else, then you can enable the ","Temp ","option.","\n  ","Once you have defined the name and the parameters, you can attach the actions that you want the function to run when it is called in your code, by dropping them to the side of the action as shown in the image below:","\n  ","You can see examples of using this action as both a regular function and a constructor function in the \"Extended Examples\" section given below.","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","\n  "],["\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Name","\n        ","The name of the new function.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument [+]","\n        ","The different arguments that can be passed into the function, and their default values if optional.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Constructor","\n        ","Whether this function is a constructor.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Static","\n        ","Whether this function is static.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Temp","\n        ","Whether the function is temporary (meaning that it's only used within the current event).","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  "],["\n  ","The above action block would go in the ","Create Event"," of an instance or a script, and declares a new function called ","set_vec"," with three arguments: ","_x",", ","_y"," and ","spd",".
