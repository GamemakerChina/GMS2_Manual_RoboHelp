You need to supply both the source and the destination arrays (both need to have been created previously), as well as a position within the source array to copy from and a position within the destination array to copy to. Finally you need to specify the length of the array (or the length of the part that you want) to copy. If the data being copied exceeds the length of the destination array, the array will be extended to accept the data.","\n  ","This function can also be used for multi-dimension arrays, as long as you specify which dimension you want to copy when you supply the array index, following this pattern:","\n  ","// Copy to the first dimension of an array","\n    // from the second dimension of an array","\n    array_copy(item_array, 0, inventory_array[0], 0, len);","\n    ","\n    // Copy to the third dimension of an array","\n    // from the first dimension of an array","\n    array_copy(item_array[0][0], 0, inventory_array, 0, len);","\n    ","\n    // etc...\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","array_copy(dest, dest_index, src, src_index, length);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Type","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","dest","\n        ","Array","\n        ","The ID of the array to copy to.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","dest_index","\n        ","Real","\n        ","The index within the array to copy to.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","src","\n        ","Array","\n        ","The ID of the array to copy from.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","src_index","\n        ","Real","\n        ","The index with the array to start copying from.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","length","\n        ","Real","\n        ","The length (number of array indices) to copy.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","if !array_equals(inventory_array, item_array)","\n    {","\n        var len = array_length(inventory_array);","\n        array_copy(item_array, 0, inventory_array, 0, len);","\n    }","\n  ","The above code will check two arrays to see if they hold equivalent values, and if they do not then the code will copy the entire contents of the array \"inventory_array\" into the array \"item_array\".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Array Functions","\n        ","Next: ","array_equals","\n      ","\n    ","\n    "],["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"]],"4":[["array_copy"]],"5":[["Syntax:"],["Returns:"],["Example:"]],"6":[["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2022 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"2238"})
