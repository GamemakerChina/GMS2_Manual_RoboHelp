You supply the string to parse, and the function will return the top level array or struct which can then be used in your code. If you are not sure of the contents of the JSON, you can use the different ","Variable Functions"," (like ","typeof()"," and ","variable_struct_get_names()"," in case of a struct) to check the returned contents.
