When an instance is rendered in ","GameMaker"," , the depth of a generated pixel (its z coordinate) is stored in the z-buffer, then, if another instance of the scene must be rendered at the same pixel, the two depths are compared (z-testing - see ","gpu_set_ztestenable()",") and the one \"closer\" to the observer is then saved to the z-buffer, replacing the old one. However, this is not always what you wish to happen and there are moments when you may want something to be drawn over everything else, no matter what its z value is. In those cases you can use this function to switch off writing to the z-buffer and so force whatever is being drawn to be drawn over everything else.
