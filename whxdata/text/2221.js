This will work for precise collisions, but only if both the instance and the instances of the object being checked for have precise collision masks selected, otherwise only bounding box collisions are applied.","\n  ","You supply a ","DS list"," too, so the ","id"," values of any instances that are colliding with the calling instance will be added to the end of the given list.
