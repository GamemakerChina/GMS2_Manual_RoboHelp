However all blending in this way creates a duplicate\n    sprite which is then stored in the cache and used when required. This is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance unless you activate WebGL. if you do not wish to use WebGL, then you can set\n    the font cache size to try and limit this should it be necessary using the function ","sprite_set_cache_size()",".","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","draw_sprite_tiled_ext(sprite, subimg, x, y, xscale, yscale, colour, alpha);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","Type","\n        ","Description","\n     ","\n      ","\n        ","sprite","Sprite Asset","\n        ","The index of the sprite to draw.","\n     ","\n      ","\n        ","subimg","Real","\n        ","The subimg (frame) of the sprite to draw (image_index or -1 correlate to the current frame of animation in the object).","\n     ","\n      ","\n        ","x","Real","\n        ","The x coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n     ","\n      ","\n        ","y","Real","\n        ","The y coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n     ","\n      ","\n        ","xscale","Real","\n        ","The horizontal scaling of the sprite.
