These errors are ","Runner Errors"," and so they are shown while the game is running: "," ","The following table lists the possible errors that you may get when working with the Rollback system and a description. It also provides a solution for every specific error message."," ","Error"," ","Description"," ","Could not get the layer to create players. You should pass layer name to the rollback_define_player function or create Instances layer."," ","If the player object was defined with ","rollback_define_player"," function, the rollback system will try to create the player object on the layer, of which the name can optionally be passed as a second parameter (or on the layer with name \"Instances\" if not defined). If the layer couldn't be found by its name this error is fired. The solution is to either explicitly set the layer name to create the players on or to create a layer with name \"Instances\" if you don't set the layer name explicitly."," ","Player objects must be managed when running multiplayer games."," ","If the player object was defined with ","rollback_define_player"," function and the player object is not flagged as managed this error is fired. The solution is to mark the player object as managed in the ","Object Editor","."," ","Failed to get user info for player_id N."," ","If the rollback system wasn't able to get information from the server about the player this error is fired. Check the developer console to see if any requests were blocked."," ","Could not call rollback_chat before fully connected to the game. Try waiting for the rollback_game_info event."," ","The chat function is not available until the player has joined the room. Solution: Disable chat until rollback_game_info event received (See ","Rollback Events",")."," ","rollback_use_manual_start must be called before rollback_create_game and rollback_join_game."," ","These errors are fired if a function call violates internal state machine constraints.

Usually this happens in the following cases: 1. One user tries to reset player prefs while the other user already started the game. In this case the game should use the last successfully set user prefs, we guarantee that each player should set some user prefs before the game can be started. 2.
