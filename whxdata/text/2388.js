The \"offset\" defines the start position within the buffer for saving (in bytes), and the \"size\" is the size of the buffer area to be saved from that offset onwards (also in bytes). This function works asynchronously, and so the game will continue running while being saved, and all files saved using this function will be placed in a \"default\" folder. This folder does ","not"," need to be included in the filename as it is added automatically by GameMaker. For example the filename path \"","Data\\Player_Save.sav","\" would actually be saved to \"","default\\Data\\Player_Save.sav","\". However, if you then load the file using the function ","buffer_load_async()",", you do not need to supply the \"default\" part of the path either (but any other file function ","will"," require it, except on consoles Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch).","\n  ","NOTE",": On HTML5 \"default/\" is not added automatically and you may have to account for this in your code.","\n  ","The function will return a unique ID value and trigger an ","Asynchronous Save/Load Event"," where you can use the returned ID to check the ","async_load"," ID value, as shown in the extended example below.
