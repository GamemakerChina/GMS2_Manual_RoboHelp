For example, if you wanted to put quotation marks within a string you would have something like this:","\n  ","str = \"Hello\\\"World\\\"!\";","\n  ","GameMaker"," also has full four byte wide Unicode character support, allowing you to decode and encode Unicode characters in the upper bounds of the standard (including - but not limited to - emoji).","\n  ","To deal with Unicode characters, you can use a backslash ","\\"," to precede any Unicode literal - digits of hex preceded by a \"","u","\", for example \"","\\u00e2","\" for \"á\"- where the digits are the number of the Unicode character. When working with Unicode in this way, you need to be aware of the fact that ","GameMaker"," will interpret ","all"," digits following the \"","u","\", so if you wanted to write \"áa\" for example, you should use:","\n  ","\"\\u00e2\\a\"","\n  ","or","\n  ","\"\\u00e2\\u61\"","\n  ","or","\n  ","\"\\u00e2\" + \"a\"","\n  ","Just using \"","\\u00e2a","\" would actually result in the Unicode character \"","ส","\" (essentially becoming \"","\\ue2a","\").","\n  ","GameMaker"," can also handle any hexadecimal literal - normally written as digits of hex following \"","0x","\", for example \"","0xff","\", where the digits form the character code of the character to use.
