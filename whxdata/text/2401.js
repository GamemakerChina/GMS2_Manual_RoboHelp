The sequence ID is the name constant that you defined in the Asset Browser for the sequence. The function will return the unique ID of the sequence element, which can then be used in all further layer functions for sequences, or it can be used to retrieve the sequence instance struct using the function ","layer_sequence_get_instance()",".","\n  ","It is worth noting that if the sequence contains any object tracks, their instances will be created as soon as the sequence element itself is created, regardless of where their asset keys are positioned on the ","Dope Sheet",".
