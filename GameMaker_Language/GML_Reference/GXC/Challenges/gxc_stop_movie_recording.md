# gxc_stop_movie_recording

This function is used to stop a GXC recording that was previously
started with
[gxc_start_movie_recording()](gxc_start_movie_recording) . It also
submits the recording to the URL specified in the arguments, however the
behaviour is different depending on the kind of string specified:

-   If you specify a file name, the recording will be saved with that
    name in your Downloads folder
-   If you specify a URL, the recording will be uploaded to that URL

The URL method should be used when the recording needs to be uploaded to
GXC, and the file should be saved locally only for checking whether the
recording was successful.

#### Syntax:

``` gml
gxc_stop_movie_recording(filename);
```

|          |                                                                           |                                                                     |

| Argument | Type                                                                      | Description                                                         |
| filename |  [String](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | The file name or URL where the recording is to be saved or uploaded |

#### Returns:

``` gml
N/A
```

#### Example:

``` gml
gxc_submit_challenge_score(_score, function(_status, _result) {
    var _uploadUrl = _result.data.gameplayVideoUploadUrl;
    gxc_stop_movie_recording(_uploadUrl);
});
```

The above code uses the GXC API Library to upload a score to the
currently active challenge, and when a response is received in its
callback method, it retrieves the upload URL for the video and uploads
the recording to it.
